0/ What Webhouse is
-------------------

   Webhouse is your place on the Internet. It is not under any platform. It runs on your domain and you totally control its content - in TXT files. WebHouse turns URLs into rich view (like in social network post or in search engine results).
   
   Webhouse is a simple form for your matter.


[SEE A DEMO](https://whdemo.fanky.eu/)

1/ Get a domain
---------------
https://www.google.com/search?q=register+a+domain&oq=register+a+domain

2/ Get a hosting (linux server space)
-------------------------------------

https://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting

3/ Download a FTP "notepad"
---------------------------
for example PSPad. With this, when you save a text file, it gets published on the web.

4/ Connect your notepad to FTP
------------------------------
with credentials got from your webhost

5/ Download webhouse and extract it to your hosting
---------------------------------------------------
(a hidden .htaccess file + TXT file + webhouse directory) to your hosting


6/ Open the TXT and write
-------------------------
what you want to tell the world! Links will get converted to rich previews. Hit Ctrl+S and see the published outcome in your browser.

7/ Create directories and TXT files inside them
-----------------------------------------------
and share them - anyone with the link (yoursite.com/yourdirectory) can view

What's next?
------------

Webhouse will be connected with emails inviting your friends inside. So if you let e.g. your friends mail links to playlist@myclass.com, you and your friends will find them at myclass.com/playlist. So we will slightly move from the first step - decentralised user profiles - to the next one - a decentralised social network.
